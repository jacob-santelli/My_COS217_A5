What is your mywc program test plan?

mywcBoundary1.txt: a blank file, to ensure mywc.s and mywc.c work on
completely empty files. 

mywcBoundary2.txt: a file of only newlines, to ensure mywc.s and 
mywc.c work on a series of repeated newline characters.

mywcBoundary3.txt: a file of only tabs, to ensure mywc.s and 
mywc.c work on a series of repeated tab characters.

mywcBoundary4.txt: a file of only spaces, to ensure mywc.s and
mywc.c work on a series of repeated space characters.

mywcBoundary5.txt: a file of a single char, to ensure mywc.s and
mywc.c work on a single char.

mywcBoundary6.txt: a file of a single word, to ensure mywc.s and
mywc.c work on a single word.

mywcBoundary7.txt: a file of a single newline, to ensure mywc.s and
mywc.c work on a single newline.

mywcBoundary8.txt: a file of every single permitted ASCII character,
to ensure mywc.s and mywc.c work on many permitted ASCII 
characters. 

mywcBoundary9.txt: a file of many words, to ensure mywc.s and mywc.c 
work on many words.

mywcBoundary10.txt: a file of many lines of text, to ensure mywc.s and 
mywc.c work on many lines (with words in them).

mywcStatement1.txt: contains 'a', followed by a space, then a newline 
character, and finally a 'b.' 'a' tests lines 0-34, 42-48, and 50. 
The space tests lines 30-41, 48, and 50. The newline tests lines 30-34 
and 42-50. The 'b' tests 30-34, 42-44, 46, and 50-57. Together, this 
successfully tests every single line in the program at least once.

mywcStress1.txt: 50,000 randomly generated characters, sampling every
single permitted character in the selection.
